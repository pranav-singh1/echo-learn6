# EchoLearn Chat Feature: Updated Interaction Rules

## Overview

The EchoLearn Chat Feature has been updated with new interaction rules that provide a seamless transition between voice and text communication while maintaining context continuity.

## Key Features

### 1. Input Lock During Active Voice Session

- **Behavior**: As soon as a user begins speaking with EchoLearn, the chat input box is automatically disabled
- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - Text input field shows "Text input locked during voice session..." placeholder
  - Red pulsing dot with "Voice Active" label appears in the input field
  - "Voice Session Active" badge appears in the header
  - Informational message explains the current state
- **User Experience**: Prevents accidental text entry during voice interactions

### 2. Re-enabling Text Chat

- **Trigger**: When the user clicks "Stop Voice" to end their spoken interaction
- **Behavior**: Text input field is automatically re-enabled
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - Input field returns to normal state
  - Voice session indicators disappear
  - Success message appears indicating text input is unlocked

### 3. Transcript Context Injection

- **Automatic Context**: When text input is first unlocked and the user submits their initial message, the system automatically includes the full transcript of the preceding EchoLearn voice session
- **Format**: The transcript is formatted as:
  ```
  Voice Session Transcript:
  You: [user's voice messages]
  EchoLearn: [AI responses]
  
  User's Text Message: [user's new text message]
  ```
- **One-Time Use**: The transcript context is only included with the first text message after a voice session
- **Clear State**: After the first text message, subsequent messages work normally without transcript injection

## High-Level Workflow

1. **User Starts Voice Chat** → Chat box locks with visual indicators
2. **User Finishes Voice Chat** → Chat box unlocks with success message
3. **User Types First Text Message** → System bundles prior transcript + new message → Forwards both to OpenAI
4. **Subsequent Text Messages** → Normal text chat without transcript injection

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

The feature uses several new state variables in the AppContext:

- `isVoiceSessionActive`: Tracks whether a voice session is currently running
- `voiceSessionTranscript`: Stores the transcript of the voice session
- `isTextInputLocked`: Controls whether text input is disabled
- `hasSentFirstTextAfterVoice`: Tracks if the first text message after voice has been sent

### Visual Feedback

- **Voice Session Active**: Red pulsing indicators and locked input styling
- **Transcript Ready**: Green success message when voice session ends
- **Normal State**: Standard input field when no voice session is active

### Error Handling

- Voice session state is properly reset on connection errors
- Transcript is cleared after first use to prevent duplicate injection
- Graceful fallback if transcript generation fails

## User Benefits

1. **Clear Interaction Model**: Users understand when they can use voice vs text
2. **Context Continuity**: Voice session context is automatically carried forward to text chat
3. **Visual Clarity**: Multiple visual indicators prevent confusion about current state
4. **Seamless Transition**: Smooth handoff between voice and text modes

## Future Enhancements

- Option to manually include transcript in subsequent messages
- Transcript preview before sending first text message
- Voice session duration indicators
- Customizable transcript formatting options
